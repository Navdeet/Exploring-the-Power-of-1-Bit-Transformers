🚀 BitNet-LLama-70M: Exploring the Power of 1-Bit Transformers
A 70M parameter model leveraging Microsoft’s breakthrough "1-bit LLMs" architecture to push the boundaries of lightweight, efficient large language models.

🔬 About BitNet-LLama-70M
BitNet-LLama-70M is an experimental model that demonstrates the effectiveness of 1-bit Transformer training, inspired by Microsoft’s research from "The Era of 1-bit LLMs: All Large Language Models are in 1.58 Bits." With only 70M parameters and trained on a subset of the cosmopedia dataset, BitNet-LLama-70M aims to showcase how even small models can leverage bit-level weight efficiency for effective scaling and performance.

BitLinear Layer: Introducing BitLinear, a custom layer that replaces PyTorch’s nn.Linear, enabling training with 1-bit weights from scratch. This reduces computational load while maintaining high accuracy in parameter representation.

Memory and Energy Efficiency: By replacing traditional FP16 and 8-bit quantization, BitNet’s 1-bit weights dramatically reduce the memory footprint, cutting down the energy required for model training and deployment.

Scaling Efficiency: BitNet demonstrates that scaling properties akin to full-precision Transformers can be achieved with bit-level weights, suggesting promising potential for larger 1-bit models.

Performance Potential: While BitNet is still in experimental stages, it has shown competitive performance against state-of-the-art 8-bit and FP16 baselines on language modeling tasks.

NO MORE FLOATS! Instead of floating-point weights, BitNet-LLama-70M uses weights defined by just [1, 0, -1], further simplifying computation requirements.

🏋️‍♂️ Model Training Setup
Dataset: Trained on a subset of HuggingFace’s cosmopedia dataset.
Epochs: 2
Hardware: 1x A100 GPU
Training Framework: wandb for tracking and reporting training metrics.
Note: Due to its experimental nature and smaller size, BitNet-LLama-70M may not produce high-quality results in conversational tasks. However, it serves as a powerful proof-of-concept for scalable, low-precision models.

🌌 Next Steps and Future Plans
Explore Larger Parameter Counts: While BitNet-LLama-70M is only 70M parameters, future iterations could expand to hundreds of millions or billions of parameters.
Optimize Chat Quality: Fine-tuning BitNet with optimized training datasets and techniques could improve response quality.
Extend to More Domains: Testing across varied datasets to evaluate performance in other domains and tasks.
